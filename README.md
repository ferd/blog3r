blog3r
=====

A rebar plugin attempting to re-make https://github.com/ferd/blogerl but as a rebar3
plugin for a custom compiler module so that it can reuse the DAG code and do partial
blog re-builds without having to handle the tracking itself.

This is still experimental code and I wouldn't expect anyone to use it at this point.

Structure
---

The plugin expects to work on the following project structure:

```
./
├─rebar.config
├─src/
│ └─ some.app.src
├─templates/
│ ├─ index.tpl
│ ├─ rss.tpl
│ ├─ base.tpl
│ └─ ...
├─posts/
│ ├─ post1.tpl
│ ├─ post2.tpl
│ ├─ post3.tpl
│ └─ ...
└─compiled/
  ├─ index.html
  ├─ feed.rss
  ├─ post1-generated-slug.html
  ├─ post2-generated-slug.html
  ├─ post3-generated-slug.html
  └─ ...
```

- A `rebar.config` configuration file
- The `src/` directory is required strictly for the project to be picked up by rebar3. If you do want to write code snippets and test them to only later import them into the blog, that can be a decent place to do it still.
- The `templates/` directory contains basic Django templates and is used as the `doc_root` (default lookup path) for all inclusions for paths. Only files with the `.tpl` extension are picked up.
- The `posts/` directory should contain only specific blog posts' template files. Only files with the `.tpl` extension are picked up.
- The `compiled/` directory is where the plugin currently puts all the rendered posts, at the top level.
- A `_build` directory will always be generated by rebar3 even though you may not need it.

There is also an assumed dependency on [pygments](https://pygments.org/) being installed for code highlighting to be done entirely offline. Code declared with `<pre class="erlang">...</pre>` will get erlang syntax highlight, for example. Warnings will be output if pygments isn't available.

Configuration
---

Add the plugin to your rebar config, and configure the blogs and blog posts:

```erlang
{project_plugins, [
    {blog3r, {git, "https://github.com/ferd/blog3r.git", {branch, "main"}}}
]}.

{blog3r, [
    %% Variables that are defined in all templates
    {vars, [
        {url, [{base, "https://example.org/"},
               {img, "https://example.org/static/img/"},
               {js, "https://example.org/static/js/"},
               {css, "https://example.org/static/css/"},
               {erl, "https://example.org/static/erl/"}]}
    ]},

    %% Define an index of all blog post entries
    {index, [
        %% Name of the index file itself
        {template, "index.tpl"},
        %% List of all the posts by date, title, and name of the post template
        {mappings, [
             %% Datetime in RFC 2822 format,  Title of the post,  Source file
            {"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 00:00:00 EDT", "Hello, World", "hello.tpl"},
            {"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 00:00:00 EST", "Second article", "second.tpl"},
            %% ...
            {"Fri, 01 May 2020 10:00:00 EDT", "Complexity Has to Live Somewhere", "complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.md.tpl"},
            {"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 10:00:00 EDT", "You Reap What You Code", "you-reap-what-you-code.md.tpl"}
        ]}
    ]},

    %% How to generate the RSS Feed. A template should have it
    %% already set in the project structure.
    {feed, [
        {template, "rss.tpl"},
        {num_entries, 5}
    ]}
]}.

%% Additional hooks if you want things to work in a standard way
{pre_hooks, [
    {compile, "mkdir -p compiled/static"}
]}.
{post_hooks, [
    {compile, "cp -r static/* compiled/static/"}
]}.
```

## Roadmap

- Add templates for posts and basic structure
- Add a demo blog (possibly just using the templates)
- Revamp the terrible markdown handling
